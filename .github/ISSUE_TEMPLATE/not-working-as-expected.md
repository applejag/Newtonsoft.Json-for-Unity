There are thousands of Json.NET questions on Stack Overflow with the json.net tag.

These GitHub issues are only for reporting issues with the package itself. Try evaluate if the problem relates to Newtonsoft.Json or this fork that delivers it for Unity. If it is, report it at JamesNK's repository:
